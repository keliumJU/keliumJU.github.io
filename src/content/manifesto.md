For along time i was running away of competitive programming(CP), i think that this is a very important thing that i need to do, and practice conscientiously, i need to do this for my carrer. Every day for all day or almost all days i want to practice for 1 hour minimun CP or leetcode, i want to begin with neetcode guides and after move with CP, i want to love solve problems or try to solve problems, and maybe i can improve some my english level(prayer).

> **Note:** this manifesto need to be fulfilled
