Today was the day, i apply every advice of [Colin Galen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdp2WeyuJY) to read good the problem and take the necessary time to fail, i mean not got with the first idea, instead try to find edge cases to find a better solution, for that right now i don't debug a lot(only the necessary), the problem based in the `x = y` equation to identlfy the different kingdoms, we can suppose that the kingdom A is up to the line(`x=y`) and the kingdom B is down, the trick is that exist a gate in every point of the rect, you only pay when you pass, not in the gate only when you are in the gate and the next move is the same of the previous in that moment you go into the kingdom.
