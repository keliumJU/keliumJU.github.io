Today was a bad day i cannot focus in the CP problems but avanced in the USACO Guide, so my first propblem was this <https://open.kattis.com/problems/basketballoneonone> the solution with logic is very easy, only i need to check every char in the string and if it's a 'A' or 'B' i need to sum the value of the character aside, i was saving this values in two different accumulators, the answer is 'A' or 'B' in base to more highest value. Follow i share the code

``` java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BasketBallOneOnOne {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            String line = scanner.nextLine();
            int totalA = 0;
            int totalB = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < line.length(); i++) {
                if (line.charAt(i) == 'A') {
                    totalA += (int) line.charAt(i + 1);
                } else if (line.charAt(i) == 'B') {
                    totalB += (int) line.charAt(i + 1);
                }
            }
            if (totalA > totalB) {
                System.out.println("A");
            } else {
                System.out.println("B");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
I know that the better approach it's tricky but, this works for me, for know, tomorrow i going to check other problem probably and continue with the USACO guide, bye fish
